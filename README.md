# A repo for some of the cogs I have built for Red - Discord bot

## Help
For help you can either use a bug report issue, go to the [support server](discord.gg/JmCFyq7), or ask in Red's [cog support server](https://discord.gg/GET4DVk) in `#support_othercogs`

## Suggestions
For suggestions you can either make an enhancement issue or ask/ping me in either the cog support server or my support server listed in [Help](https://github.com/Just-Jojo/JojoCogs#help)

## Forking
Forks are great! 🍴
If you would like to contribute, make personal edits, or just about anything just fork this repo (just don't blame me for the bad code)

Also, read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (:

## Cogs
Here are some of the cogs I've written. Anything marked `X` in the approved section has been approved by me to be pretty much working as intended
Anything marked with `O`, however, is either not working or hasn't been finished
